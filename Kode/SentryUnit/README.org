* Flash to device
With the environment setup, the next step is to build and flash, this is done using this command:
: $ idf.py build

Then flash to the device using:
: $ idf.py -p PORT flash

Where port is the device something like ~/dev/ttyACM0~ or ~/dev/ttyUSB0~, if not found do the following:
: $ ls /dev/tty -l
Then plug in the ESP32 and repeat the command.

To monitor simply use:
: $ idf.py -p PORT monitor
